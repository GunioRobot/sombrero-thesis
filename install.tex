\section{Installation}
\subsection{Windows and Linux}
The installation in Windows can be done many ways. The first one would be to download sombrero.war and deploy it into a serverlet container application server, like Tomcat, Jetty or Glassfisch. Another possibility would be to download the root directory of sombrero and to navigate into it. After that the command \lstinline!mvn jetty:run! should be written into the shell and sombrero should run smoothly. By the way this is the only possible solution to run the latest version of sombrero.

Sombrero has been tested with firefox 3.6 and Java 1.6. So if you install these recommended applications there should be no problems concerning sombrero.
