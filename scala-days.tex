\section{Scala Days 2010}

In May, we noticed that the Scala Days 2010 were coming along, and decided to go there, hoping to learn something that could help us with sombrero. The Scala Days 2010 were the first Scala workshop, and were held at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the 15th and 16th of April. While we had a wonderful time and learned a lot, we were not able to use any of the new technologies in sombrero as there was to little time left and the project was already far advanced.

If we do get the opportunity to further improve sombrero, we would most surely make use of the knowledge we earned at Scala Days. The first step would be to rebase to Scala 2.8, which provides exciting new features we would like to use, most importantly package objects, which are packages with member variables and functions, and named and default parameters. Another tool we would like to use is sbt, the Scala build tool. Sbt is fully configurable in Scala and was designed to ease Lift development, so it's a perfect fit for sombrero. We were also very delighted to hear that Eclipse support will improve with the release of Scala 2.8.
