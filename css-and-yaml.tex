\subsection{CSS}
``Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation semantics (that is, the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages  written in HTML  and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including SVG and XUL.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).''\cite{wikipedia.org:css}
