\chapter{Conclusion}

Building automation, and smart homes in particular, will get increasingly more common and widespread in the next few years. In this diploma thesis project, we tried to develop an easy to use interface to control your intelligent home. While our solution is limited to closed home networks, even this can be used through a smartphone to create a remote control for your entire house. The next logical step would be to test it and make it secure enough to allow access from the internet. Then you would be able to control your house from wherever you are.

To think even further, one could use the various sensors in modern smartphones to detect behaviour patterns and make the house react accordingly. For example, when you are driving home from your skiing holidays, your smartphone will notice this through its GPS sensor and would notify your house, which would then begin heating so its warm and cozy by the time you arrive.

During the creation of sombrero we learned that this and a lot more would already be possible with todays technologies. We hope sombrero will grow to be the technology that provides this functionality.
